# Word-guessing game

This is a Makers Academy challenge from three week course on Java - week 1.

## Specifications of the game

In this week's pairing challenge, you'll build an old school favourite â€” a word-guessing game in the terminal! Here's the specification for this game:

* When the game starts, it will choose a random word from a list of words.
* The game will then display the word to guess, with only the first letter visible (e.g H____ for "HOUSE").
* The player starts a counter of 10 attempts.
* The player will then be prompted to enter a letter they think might be in the word.
* If the letter is in the word, the game will display the word to guess, with the new letter visible.
* If the letter is not in the word, the game will display the same letters as before, and decrease the counter of remaining attempts.
* If the counter of attempts reaches zero, the player loses.
* If the player finds all the letters in the word, they win.

## Learning Objectives
* Initialising a new project with gradle.
* Writing a test class and tests
* Writing a class and a method.
* Define a class constructor.
* Define class attributes.
* Using a loop and some of Java's built-in classes, like StringBuilder.
* Running tests.
